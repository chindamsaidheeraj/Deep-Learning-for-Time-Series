# Deep-Learning-for-Time-Series

## Project Objectives:
• The main objective is to implement multiple modern time series models and 
recommend suitable approaches for use cases like multivariate and multiple time 
series forecasting based on merits, demerits, supporting implementations and logical 
analysis.

• For multiple time series forecasting, modern modelling approaches like Deep AR 
(autoregressive neural networks) and N-beats (Neural basis expansion) need to be 
developed and compared with effective scenarios and provide recommendations 
concerning the nature of the data sets.

• For Multivariate time series, LSTM models need to be compared with traditional 
methods like ARIMAX using datasets with varying characteristics to understand 
effective scenarios, merits, and demerits and recommend optimal approaches.

More details of implementations in report.
